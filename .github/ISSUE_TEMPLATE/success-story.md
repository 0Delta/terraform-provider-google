This is a different kind of issue, in that it's not an issue at all. It's a way for you to share
your story of how the Google provider helped you, worked out well for your project, or
in other ways contributed to your project's success. You're free to share as much or as
little detail as you like--from sharing the exact config you used, to not even mentioning
the name of the company or the project.

Issues posted using this template don't require maintainer work, so they'll be automatically
closed, but will be labeled using the `success-story` label, so other users can find them,
and can gauge what the project is useful for and how it can help them.
